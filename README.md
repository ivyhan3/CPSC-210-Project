# BC Hikes Info Database

## UBC CPSC 210 Personal Project

*Hello!*

My project is a collection of stats and info of the beautiful
hikes in BC to be easily accessed for those looking for a suitable hike. 
Based on one's personal factors including their skill level, location,
and interests, this easy-to-navigate database is made to accommodate all levels of hikers and helps find the 
perfect hike based on their preferences. As an avid hiker, this project is of particular interest
to me as I find it tedious to search online for the perfect hike sometimes, with so many options to choose from and many
factors to consider. I believe that many more people in BC are resorting to hikes as social distancing measures are in 
place. Thus, I want to create a simple database that contains all the hiking info needed in one place. 

What kind of info can I search for with this database?
- What hikes are in Coquitlam?
- List the hikes that are under 5km.
- At which hikes can I spot a Whisky Jack bird?

Let's get started!
